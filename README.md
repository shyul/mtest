How to use mboot
----------------
1. The microSD card should be larger than 8GByte, and prepared by Lophilo OS card partition tool.
2. The prepared card has two partitions: boot (1GByte, MSDOS FAT), linux (from 7GByte to card size limit, Linux EXT4).
3. Insert the SDcard to PC's card reader, and mount the "boot" partition (on Windows, only "boot" partition is recognized and automatically list in "My Computer").
4. Copy the generated excutable binary "boot.bin" (File name is sensitive) to the "boot" partition.
5. Also copy "boot.ini", "zImage" and "grid.rbf" (File names are all sensitive) to the "boot" partition.
6. DD the OS filesystem to the "linux" partition.
7. Put microSD card to the card holder on XEM, and we are done.

Facts about mboot
-----------------
1. Only for booting Linux on Lophilo's hardware platform.
2. Running directly from micro SDcard, no need to program any special flash on hardware.
3. Initially developed with Keil MDK, then the project was converted for developing with gcc.
4. Final excutable binary size should be limited under 55kByte to fit into SAM9M10's IRAM.
5. Some code is based on ATMEL's at91lib.
